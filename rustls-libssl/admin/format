# rustfmt cannot generally format the inside of macro invocations,
# because they can invent their own syntax.
#
# in the case of the `entry!` macro in src/entry.rs, we specifically
# try and keep the syntax the same as a rust function definition.
#
# that means we can trick rustfmt into formatting it by replacing
# `entry!` with `mod entry`, and then restore it back afterwards.
